# Mediary 

Mediary is an application that helps you relax. You can take some time and meditate or write about your day in a diary.

Mediary is built using JavaFX, CSS and MySQL database which keeps data about diary entries.

If you plan to clone the repository to try it out, you first need to download "Resources" folder here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13Ha6Eep1BRyKJWKuvnB0ARBAtEa8Q3AD?usp=sharing

Place "Resources" folder in your Mediary repository and you are good to go.
